This examples are intended to be used with GNU COBOL (Open Cobol).

Note: you must set-up a LIXA state server (lixad) as explained in 
      "LIXA reference guide" https://sourceforge.net/p/lixa/wiki/Home/
      before running example programs. If the state server is not active,
      the client program will not be able to connect to it.

This brief instruction explains how you can compile them.

1. Add LIXA utilities to your PATH, for example:
   export PATH=$PATH:/opt/lixa/bin
2. Add LIXA libraries to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH, for example:
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/lixa/lib
3. Disable gcc linking "--no-as-needed" option for COBOL programs:
   export COB_LDFLAGS=-Wl,--no-as-needed
4. Compile the interested COBOL <programname> with this command line:
     cobc -x $(lixa-config -f -l) <programname>

NOTE: look at LIXA Reference Guide for full explanation of program build
