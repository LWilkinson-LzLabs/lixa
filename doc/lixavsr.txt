The robot accepts only 3 types of rows:
1. <comment>

3. <quit>
<quit> is a special type of <command> and shutdown the robot. Every sequence
	of commands must be terminated by <quit> to guarantee the proper
	clean-up

<freetext> ::= any valid ASCII sequence terminated by newline

 # This is NOT a valid comment

<command> ::= <thread> <separator> <function> <separator> <expectedrc>
<thread> ::= 0|1|2|3|... a non negative integer with the meaning of "thread of
		control". Use a sequence starting from 0 for the first one,
		1 for the second one and so on.
<separator> ::= /
<function> ::= <openclose> | <transfunct> | <quit>
<openclose> ::= open|close <leftpar> <opencloseargs> <rightpar>
<leftpar> ::= (
<rightpar> ::= )
<opencloseargs> ::= <info> <comma> <rmid> <comma> <flags>
<info> ::= a string surrounded by quotes like "open string"
<comma> ::= ,
<rmid> ::= 0|1|2|3|... a non negative integer with the meaning of "resource
